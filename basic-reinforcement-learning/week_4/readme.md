Week 4

**Q-learning**
<br/>One of the reinforcement learning algorithms, which was introduced by Chris Watkins in 1989.
<br/>It trains an agent to assign values to its possible actions based on its current state, **without requiring a model of the environment (model-free)**. It can handle problems with stochastic transitions and rewards without requiring adaptations.
<br/>TThe core of the algorithm uses the Bellman equation and takes state(s) and action(a) as input. The equation simplifies the state values and state-action value calculation.
