**Q-learning**
<br/>One of the reinforcement learning algorithms, which was introduced by Chris Watkins in 1989.
<br/>It trains an agent to assign values to its possible actions based on its current state, **without requiring a model of the environment (model-free)**. It can handle problems with stochastic transitions and rewards **without requiring adaptations.
