**SARSA**
<br/>State-Action-Reward-State-Action, a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm. 

**Limitations**
<br/>Because of its on-policy nature, it can result in suboptimal policies and slower learning if the exploration strategy is not well-tuned or if the optimal path requires deviating significantly from the initially learned policy.
