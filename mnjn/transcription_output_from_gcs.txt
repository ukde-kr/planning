Speaker 0: okay well first off thank you for your time and partly in the interview so before we officially start can you kind of explain what you do in terms of your research your work and your background and yeah yeah so I do both the special mix the big thing so high throughput techniques and try and map if you hold sell ones the biggest example of that is is located as part of my work I've been working on the ia version of lock it with a different mass spectrometry acquisition method right so that's one thing I've been working on gold my overall project though does have a biological goal as well I am interested in gene therapy and sometimes ridiculously the safety and toxicity associated with gene therapy so I'm looking into the toxicity of aavs aavs yeah and how they affect the cell when they are being transplant I think transfusing themselves trying to map if with techniques in their lily love to gain an overall view of what's happening to all of the proteins in terms of their funds changes okay fine that's really interesting and I I should know I I am not I'm not a biologic person so I may not understand everything but I did I did some buyer for medics in undergrad and I'm working at Munich so I have just a good base of understanding in terms of all that so I might ask you a really weird questions yeah but yeah yeah um for for love it but like how do you spell this and what is l o p i t okay and what can you can just quickly explain what this does or what is it a tool uh yes I can show you figure I feel like it's bad okay I was just what it's actually so essentially what we do is we gently lies the cells and this allows us just to break the membrane but to keep all of the organelles intact I see and then we do a set of centrifuge steps increasing spin speeds right each time we get a pellet at the bottom and then we can take off the liquid into another Tube and then spin it down again I see so we do that for increasing spin speeds and what this does is it essentially a few imagine in individual protein we look at the profiles across the gradient of those fractions right so if you're a protein is localised in the mitochondria and we'd expect all of the mitochondrial proteins to have the same profiles yes Cross that radio right right so that means that we can look at them markers so proteins that we know are always localised in the mitochondria and compare them to all of the IDS that we don't know right and then you know if they match then we can localise them to that's specific compartment of the cell alright okay and as I said it's it's trying to the whole cell at once in a kind of high throughput weigh okay so yeah that's essentially how it works and we we identify what's in these teams basically using mass spectrometry and and cluster everything with ecas okay that's interesting I see that's very cool um cool of that that's definitely does make sense yes I that's essentially what what we're trying to do variants of that we can we can sort of lies the cell in a different way we can we can set up the century steps differently they start distant more build the resolution and okay niece yeah so if the cool thing about this is that the weekend a lot of data and Catherine mentioned the as she uses unifi and definitely the case with me as well as when we see a protein that I I'm obviously I haven't looked in depth into every single protein in the world so I don't really know a lot of the ideas just by name so great I'll search that into uniprot and give a really good summary of function in the literature I see yeah so that's really useful to me awesome so I guess that kind of just naturally flows into like how you use your new product so it will be from whatever results that you get from the little bit and if they are proteins or jeans that you need information from you'll probably you search it through unit product and then kind of like go through in uniprop which sections do you mainly use ah yes so I can I was just trying to look through and just just know just kind of visualise what I usually do but essentially I mean this top this top one is amazing to summary of the function and all of the papers associated with it I really like the fact that the the papers are linked oh yes to everything so you can just quickly access on this validation and obviously because I'm really interested in the spatial protein I usually find myself like scrolling down to the to the sub cellular location right area and again there's it's nice to have just a list of the organelles where this protein have been found and also the the publications associated with them right so I find that very useful I think if I want to look into something more in debt I do like the information on chairs and sites because I think that again gives you a hint on functionality I see and and and maybe if it's it's it's if it's not as well of a characterized protein maybe not of all of its functions have been foundational client so it's useful to look at the but the sequence as well to see you know when you mutate a position which which positions are are important function and also what bidening science you can find Esso that's kind of what I do like if I want to look into something more in-depth alright and obviously the yeah I think that diseased information is interesting as well to kind of link it back to the function I see so I guess yeah function is like your main interest and also the like as you mentioned the sights and the bike like the Binding sites and the maragos parts of the entry yeah yeah I I think I think it's useful to compare my localisation data with the uni port localisation data to see if it's if it matches or if there's anything novel okay and then yeah a lot of it is about sort of educating myself and characterizing protean resident like in my head so yeah it's very you use this is kind of going off Topic but do you use the feature viewer at all I knew yeah I kind of I usually stay on this face okay it's you yes I don't use this very often but it is a really nice way of visualizing things I had to like the visual presentation of it it and everything all laid out yeah I see it with the tops on the left but I normally because I am looking at a lot of different protein this a lot of the time it's a quick right going through the the first yeah and there's sort of tabs that you when you do you find when you're looking when you're like looking up proteins on your product do you find a lot of them are like the like the Swissport entries like this one like the curated ones or do you also like Encounter like non created ones it would I don't know if you know the difference but it will be so any protein that has the gold tag is swiss-prot and it's curated by the creators at Enterprise so it's all like manually done and the information is auto like manually verified as well there are entries that are grey or silver in terms of that's called tremble entries and they're not really I guess they're more the unknown ones did you like ever do you ever like come across those kind of protein or those entries while you were looking at or is it mainly so I think I mean a lot of the time it kind of depends on what we're searching for in our mass spectators as well so I think you know people can use different databases and search the rule must be specified right so yeah I think it kind of depends on on the search that I see but yeah you can get a mix of depending on that and ok I understand well you just saw the the brief presentation or the intro about music maps have you ever used the original about this thing before have you ever used it I've heard I've heard of it of sort of common process I'm not used it that extensively I see you know when you go in the software yeah everything and I I haven't done a lot of that I find find a lot of the information that I I'm just on Union prostrate away okay which kind of because I do like looking at the over the PubMed links right around the literature I value that a lot I see I do think music lobster cool a cool resource okay if what would make you use music Maps more like what kind of function like if music Maps had this or like this function or that function would you go to that resource more to I mean within your workflow I guess is what I'm trying to ask well I think I mean honestly like it's probably a good idea to integrate it because I think you know if it was all here on this page then then it would be a lot more accessible so if I could just scroll through and it says one of the tabs or one of the things yeah and this page and then it would be a nice thing to kind of add to my usual routine of checking through I see so like if it's like in this if it's present in this form within your work like what would you look at within this like within this node or this graph I guess yeah so so yes the the first thing I'm looking at is is the organelles and people we can try a different one maybe there's just a bit small yeah yeah those systems okay or do you have like an example that you actually maybe like but this protein that you're looking at I don't know if it's actually here but yeah so these like subdivisions of nucleus it might interesting you've got like nuclear loom and nucleolus and then it goes down to the like RNA processing family and splicing and things like that um I kind of I think that that way of breaking it down you know with the arrows and everything is it's quite nice when it's simplified as we saw like with the with the like massive data set yeah it can be overwhelming right so you know I think I think of a way like like if you could potentially choose like a couple of proteins and see them sci-fi side and just those pathways that could be like a cool visualisation okay you can see two proteins and it just shows those nodes something like that to kind of simplify visually maybe I like also some sort of integration with with that sort of cellular location and panel because I mean this is really easy to understand you've got you've got everything sort of listed the right and then the this little picture here so it's it's really intuitive I do like this way of visualizing stuff and I think it would be really useful to kind of have like maybe a music version of that where you can I see so like if you like with a similar layout where to lists things okay so like like for example if you like click on title classroom it would like like on the music Maps it would kind of highlight or zoom in slash simplify just take out like a section within here that has a cytoplasm yeah and so I think stuff like that would be useful yeah so if you type in nuclear so it would just kind of focus on that or if you type in a specific protein and I know like another another protein you can see them side by side I think that would be cool thing it's like here so it'll be like I mean still kind of yeah jangly but so like if you do also I like the like the downwards visualisation as well or like if it's so consistent like there's like a direction yeah so you could I feel like that would be an easy I see so yes so either you know just everything goes down more quickly or everything like to the right yeah I see it could be useful okay awesome okay yes I well within these questions obviously I'm not going through these questions one by one because just because like the flow of our conversation is kind of taking a different tool but um okay so that's really nice for so I think we can almost wrap this up just one last thing is there anything in unipro I always ask this when I do use your interviews is there one thing in unique product that you would like to see improved or like what bugs you in terms of your workflow you don't have to find anything but I do like it a lot to be honest I think it's a really good resource the only thing is like you do scroll through a lot of stuff yeah but it's nice having that kind of I I sort of understand that other people have liked other reasons for easy process so it kind of makes sense to me yeah I don't know if you can like order it and some sort of way now yeah so like maybe toggle certain sections off yeah something like that so if I'm sitting here and I I wanted to go through a few proteins like I could just toggle off anything that I'm not like you know if I don't really need to actual data at that point yeah just kind of Take That so you have like you'll have like this function and like something location yeah yeah just that on all the entries so you can just go through them yeah okay I think like as I said yeah I had to do I do like having all of that information there initially yeah because it's more accessible yeah of course yeah yeah I mean thank you so much that's it for the interview I think for in terms of
